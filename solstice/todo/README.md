# Solstice TODO Tracking

This directory tracks implementation status of features.

## Directory Structure

```

```

## File Format Guidelines

Each feature TODO file should include:

### 1. Completed (✅)
List implemented features using `[x]` markers.

### 2. In Progress (🚧)
Features currently under development.

### 3. TODO (📋)
Categorized by priority:
- **High Priority** - Blocking other work or urgently needed
- **Medium Priority** - Important but not urgent
- **Low Priority** - Nice-to-have

### 4. Design Changes (🔄)
Document differences from `design-docs/`:
- What changed
- Why it changed
- Whether design doc needs update

### 5. Next Iteration Suggestions (📝)
Guidance and priorities for next development cycle.

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Create a TODO File

- Starting a new feature
- Discovering discrepancies between design doc and implementation
- Need to track many pending items

### When to Update a TODO File

- After completing a feature, move to "Completed"
- When discovering new TODOs, add them
- When design changes occur, document them

### Relationship with design-docs

- `design-docs/` - Describes "how it should work" (design intent)
- `todo/` - Describes "what's done" and "what's pending" (implementation status)

Sync periodically. When implementation diverges from design:
1. Document the change in TODO file
2. Evaluate if design doc needs update
3. If design is better, implement per design; if implementation is better, update design doc
